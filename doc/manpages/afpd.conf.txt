AFPD.CONF(5)                                                  Netatalk 2.2                                                 AFPD.CONF(5)

NAME
       afpd.conf - Configuration file used by afpd(8) to determine the setup of its file sharing services

DESCRIPTION
       /usr/local/etc/netatalk/afpd.conf is the configuration file used by afpd to determine the behavior and configuration of the
       different virtual file servers that it provides.

       Any line not prefixed with # is interpreted. The configuration lines are composed like: server name [ options ] If a - is used
       instead of a server name, the default server is specified. Server names must be quoted if they contain spaces. They must not
       contain ":" or "@". The path name must be a fully qualified path name, or a path name using either the ~ shell shorthand or any
       of the substitution variables, which are listed below.

           Note
           Each server has to be configured on a single line. Though, using "\" character, newline escaping is supported.
       The possible options and their meanings are:

APPLEVOLUMES FILES
       -defaultvol [path]
           Specifies path to AppleVolumes.default file (default is /usr/local/etc/netatalk/AppleVolumes.default).

       -systemvol [path]
           Specifies path to AppleVolumes.system file (default is /usr/local/etc/netatalk/AppleVolumes.system).

       -[no]uservol
           Enables or disables reading of the users´ individual volumes file entirely.

       -[no]uservolfirst
           Enables or disables reading of the users´ individual volumes file before processing the global AppleVolumes.default file.

AUTHENTICATION METHODS
       -uamlist [uams list]
           Comma separated list of UAMs. (The default is uams_dhx.so,uams_dhx2.so).

           The most commonly used UAMs are:

           uams_guest.so
               allows guest logins

           uams_clrtxt.so
               (uams_pam.so or uams_passwd.so) Allow logins with passwords transmitted in the clear. (legacy)

           uams_randum.so
               allows Random Number and Two-Way Random Number Exchange for authentication (requires a separate file containing the
               passwords, either /usr/local/etc/netatalk/afppasswd file or the one specified via -passwdfile. See afppasswd(1) for
               details. (legacy)

           uams_dhx.so
               (uams_dhx_pam.so or uams_dhx_passwd.so) Allow Diffie-Hellman eXchange (DHX) for authentication.

           uams_dhx2.so
               (uams_dhx2_pam.so or uams_dhx2_passwd.so) Allow Diffie-Hellman eXchange 2 (DHX2) for authentication.

           uam_gss.so
               Allow Kerberos V for authentication (optional)

       -uampath [path]
           Sets the default path for UAMs for this server (default is /usr/local/etc/netatalk/uams).

       -k5keytab [path], -k5service [service], -k5realm [realm]
           These are required if the server supports the Kerberos 5 authentication UAM.

       -ntdomain, -ntseparator
           Use for eg. winbind authentication, prepends both strings before the username from login and then tries to authenticate with
           the result through the availabel and active UAM authentication modules.

       -adminauthuser
           Specifying eg -adminauthuser root whenever a normal user login fails, afpd will try to authenticate as the specified
           adminauthuser. If this succeeds, a normal session is created for the original connecting user. Said differently: if you know
           the password of adminauthuser, you can authenticate as any other user.

CODEPAGE OPTIONS
       With OS X Apple introduced the AFP3 protocol. One of the big changes was, that AFP3 uses Unicode names encoded as Decomposed
       UTF-8 (UTF8-MAC). Previous AFP/OS versions used codepages like MacRoman, MacCentralEurope, etc.

       To be able to serve AFP3 and older clients at the same time, afpd needs to be able to convert between UTF-8 and Mac codepages.
       Even OS X clients partly still rely on codepages. As there´s no way, afpd can detect the codepage a pre AFP3 client uses, you
       have to specify it using the -maccodepage option. The default is MacRoman, which should be fine for most western users.

       As afpd needs to interact with unix operating system as well, it need´s to be able to convert from UTF8-MAC/MacCodepage to the
       unix codepage. By default afpd uses the systems LOCALE, or ASCII if your system doesn´t support locales. You can set the unix
       codepage using the -unixcodepage option. If you´re using extended characters in the configuration files for afpd, make sure your
       terminal matches the -unixcodepage.

       -unixcodepage [CODEPAGE]
           Specifies the servers unix codepage, e.g. "ISO-8859-15" or "UTF8". This is used to convert strings to/from the systems
           locale, e.g. for authenthication, server messages and volume names. Defaults to LOCALE if your system supports it, otherwise
           ASCII will be used.

       -maccodepage [CODEPAGE]
           Specifies the mac clients codepage, e.g. "MAC_ROMAN". This is used to convert strings and filenames to the clients codepage
           for OS9 and Classic, i.e. for authentication and AFP messages (SIGUSR2 messaging). This will also be the default for the
           volumes maccharset. Defaults to MAC_ROMAN.

PASSWORD OPTIONS
       -loginmaxfail [number]
           Sets the maximum number of failed logins, if supported by the UAM (currently none)

       -passwdfile [path]
           Sets the path to the Randnum UAM passwd file for this server (default is /usr/local/etc/netatalk/afppasswd).

       -passwdminlen [number]
           Sets the minimum password length, if supported by the UAM

       -[no]savepassword
           Enables or disables the ability of clients to save passwords locally

       -[no]setpassword
           Enables or disables the ability of clients to change their passwords via chooser or the "connect to server" dialog

TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS
       -[no]ddp
           Enables or disables AFP-over-Appletalk. If -proxy is specified, you must instead use -uamlist "" to prevent DDP connections
           from working. (default is -noddp)

       -[no]tcp
           Enables or disables AFP-over-TCP (default is -tcp)

       -transall
           Make both available

TRANSPORT OPTIONS
       -advertise_ssh
           Allows Mac OS X clients (10.3.3-10.4) to automagically establish a tunneled AFP connection through SSH. If this option is
           set, the server´s answers to client´s FPGetSrvrInfo requests contain an additional entry. It depends on both client´s
           settings and a correctly configured and running sshd(8) on the server to let things work.

               Note
               Setting this option is not recommended since globally encrypting AFP connections via SSH will increase the server´s load
               significantly. On the other hand, Apple´s client side implementation of this feature in MacOS X versions prior to 10.3.4
               contained a security flaw.

       -ddpaddr [ddp address]
           Specifies the DDP address of the server. The default is to auto-assign an address (0.0). This is only useful if you are
           running AppleTalk on more than one interface.

       -fqdn [name:port]
           Specifies a fully-qualified domain name, with an optional port. This is discarded if the server cannot resolve it. This
           option is not honored by AppleShare clients <= 3.8.3. This option is disabled by default. Use with caution as this will
           involve a second name resolution step on the client side. Also note that afpd will advertise this name:port combination but
           not automatically listen to it.

       -hostname [name]
           Use this instead of the result from calling hostname for dertermening which IP address to advertise, therfore the hostname
           is resolved to an IP which is the advertised. This is NOT used for listening and it is also overwritten by -ipaddr.

       -ipaddr [ip address]
           Specifies the IP address that the server should advertise and listens to. The default is advertise the first IP address of
           the system, but to listen for any incoming request. The network address may be specified either in dotted-decimal format for
           IPv4 or in hexadecimal format for IPv6. This option also allows to use one machine to advertise the AFP-over-TCP/IP settings
           of another machine via NBP when used together with the -proxy option.

           Example. afpd.conf onfiguration line

                             fluxxus -hostname afp.example.org -ipaddr 192.168.0.1 -fqdn www.example.com

           Result

           (UTF8) Server name: fluxxus, Listening and advertised network address: 192.168.0.1, Advertised network address:
           www.example.com, hostname is not used.

       -port [port number]
           Allows a different TCP port to be used for AFP-over-TCP. The default is 548.

       -proxy
           Runs an AppleTalk proxy server for the specified AFP-over-TCP server. If the address and port aren´t given, then the first
           IP address of the system and port 548 will be used. If you don´t want the proxy server to act as a DDP server as well, set
           -uamlist "".

       -server_quantum [number]
           This specifies the DSI server quantum. The default value is 303840. The maximum value is 0xFFFFFFFFF, the minimum is 32000.
           If you specify a value that is out of range, the default value will be set. Do not change this value unless you´re
           absolutely sure, what you´re doing

       -dsireadbuf [number]
           Scale factor that determines the size of the DSI/TCP readahead buffer, default is 12. This is multiplies with the DSI server
           quantum (default ~300k) to give the size of the buffer. Increasing this value might increase throughput in fast local
           networks for volume to volume copies.  Note: This buffer is allocated per afpd child process, so specifying large values
           will eat up large amount of memory (buffer size * number of clients).

       -tcprcvbuf [number]
           Try to set TCP receive buffer using setsockpt(). Often OSes impose restrictions on the applications ability to set this
           value.

       -tcpsndbuf [number]
           Try to set TCP send buffer using setsockpt(). Often OSes impose restrictions on the applications ability to set this value.

       -nozeroconf
           Disable automatic Zeroconf service registration if support was compiled in.

       -slp
           Register this server using the Service Location Protocol (if SLP support was compiled in).

MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS
       -admingroup [group]
           Allows users of a certain group to be seen as the superuser when they log in. This option is disabled by default.

       -authprintdir [path]
           Specifies the path to be used (per server) to store the files required to do CAP-style print authentication which papd will
           examine to determine if a print job should be allowed. These files are created at login and if they are to be properly
           removed, this directory probably needs to be umode 1777.

               Note
               -authprintdir will only work for clients connecting via DDP. Almost all modern Clients will use TCP.

       -client_polling
           With this switch enabled, afpd won´t advertise that it is capable of server notifications, so that connected clients poll
           the server every 10 seconds to detect changes in opened server windows.  Note: Depending on the number of simultaneously
           connected clients and the network´s speed, this can lead to a significant higher load on your network!

               Note
               Do not use this option any longer as Netatalk 2.x correctly supports server notifications, allowing connected clients to
               update folder listings in case another client changed the contents.

       -closevol
           Immediately unmount volumes removed from AppleVolumes files on SIGHUP sent to the afp master process.

       -cnidserver [ipaddress:port]
           Specifies the IP address and port of a cnid_metad server, required for CNID dbd backend. Defaults to localhost:4700. The
           network address may be specified either in dotted-decimal format for IPv4 or in hexadecimal format for IPv6.-

       -dircachesize entries
           Maximum possible entries in the directory cache. The cache stores directories and files. It is used to cache the full path
           to directories and CNIDs which considerably speeds up directory enumeration.

           Default size is 8192, maximum size is 131072. Given value is rounded up to nearest power of 2. Each entry takes about 100
           bytes, which is not much, but remember that every afpd child process for every connected user has its cache.

       -fcelistener host[:port]
           Enables sending FCE events to the specified host, default port is 12250 if not specified. Specifying mutliple listeners is
           done by having this option once for each of them.

       -fceevents fmod,fdel,ddel,fcre,dcre,tmsz
           Speficies which FCE events are active, default is fmod,fdel,ddel,fcre,dcre.

       -fcecoalesce all|delete|create
           Coalesce FCE events.

       -fceholdfmod seconds
           This determines the time delay in seconds which is always waited if another file modification for the same file is done by a
           client before sending an FCE file modification event (fmod). For example saving a file in Photoshop would generate multiple
           events by itself because the application is opening, modifying and closing a file mutliple times for every "save". Defautl:
           60 seconds.

       -guestname [name]
           Specifies the user that guests should use (default is "nobody"). The name should be quoted.

       -[no]icon
           [Don´t] Use the platform-specific icon. Recent Mac OS don´t display it any longer.

       -keepsessions
           Enable "Continuous AFP Service". This means the ability to stop the master afpd process with a SIGQUIT signal, possibly
           install an afpd update and start the afpd process. Existing AFP sessions afpd processes will remain unaffected. Technically
           they will be notified of the master afpd shutdown, sleep 15-20 seconds and then try to reconnect their IPC channel to the
           master afpd process. If this reconnect fails, the sessions are in an undefined state. Therefor it´s absolutely critical to
           restart the master process in time!

       -loginmesg [message]
           Sets a message to be displayed when clients logon to the server. The message should be in unixcodepage and should be quoted.
           Extended characters are allowed.

       -mimicmodel model
           Specifies the icon model that appears on clients. Defaults to off. Examples: RackMac (same as Xserve), PowerBook, PowerMac,
           Macmini, iMac, MacBook, MacBookPro, MacBookAir, MacPro, AppleTV1,1, AirPort.

       -noacl2maccess
           Don´t map filesystem ACLs to effective permissions.

       -nodebug
           Disables debugging.

       -sleep [number]
           AFP 3.x waits number hours before disconnecting clients in sleep mode. Default is 10 hours.

       -signature { user:<text> | auto }
           Specify a server signature. This option is useful while running multiple independent instances of afpd on one machine (eg.
           in clustered environments, to provide fault isolation etc.). Default is "auto". "auto" signature type allows afpd generating
           signature and saving it to /usr/local/etc/netatalk/afp_signature.conf automatically (based on random number). "host"
           signature type switches back to "auto" because it is obsoleted. "user" signature type allows administrator to set up a
           signature string manually. The maximum length is 16 characters.

           Example. Three server definitions using 2 different server signatures

               first -signature user:USERS
               second -signature user:USERS
               third -signature user:ADMINS

           First two servers will appear as one logical AFP service to the clients - if user logs in to first one and then connects to
           second one, session will be automatically redirected to the first one. But if client connects to first and then to third,
           will be asked for password twice and will see resources of both servers. Traditional method of signature generation causes
           two independent afpd instances to have the same signature and thus cause clients to be redirected automatically to server
           (s)he logged in first.

       -volnamelen [number]
           Max length of UTF8-MAC volume name for Mac OS X. Note that Hangul is especially sensitive to this.

               73:  limit of Mac OS X 10.1
               80:  limit for Mac OS X 10.4/10.5 (default)
               255: limit of spec

           Mac OS 9 and earlier are not influenced by this, because Maccharset volume name is always limitted to 27 bytes.

LOGGING OPTIONS
       -setuplog "<logtype> <loglevel> [<filename>]"
           Specify that any message of a loglevel up to the given loglevel should be logged to the given file. If the filename is
           ommited the loglevel applies to messages passed to syslog.

           By default afpd logs to syslog with a default logging setup equivalent to "-setuplog default log_note".

           logtypes: Default, AFPDaemon, Logger, UAMSDaemon

           loglevels: LOG_SEVERE, LOG_ERROR, LOG_WARN, LOG_NOTE, LOG_INFO, LOG_DEBUG, LOG_DEBUG6, LOG_DEBUG7, LOG_DEBUG8, LOG_DEBUG9,
           LOG_MAXDEBUG

               Note
               The config is case-ignoring

           Example. Useful default config

               - -setuplog "default log_info /var/log/afpd.log"

           Example. Debugging config

               - -setuplog "default log_maxdebug /var/log/afpd.log"

           Example. afpd logging to different files

               - -setuplog "default log_info /var/log/afpd.log" \
               -setuplog "UAMSDaemon log_maxdebug /var/log/uams.log"

       -unsetuplog "<logtype> [<filename>]"
           Note that for unsetuplog specifying any string as filename is sufficient for the config parser to distinguish between
           requests to disable syslog logging or file-logging.

           Example. Disable afpd logging set at build-time from configure

               - -unsetuplog "default -"

DEBUG OPTIONS
       These options are useful for debugging only.

       -tickleval [number]
           Sets the tickle timeout interval (in seconds). Defaults to 30.  A value of 0 disables session tickles.

       -timeout [number]
           Specify the number of tickles to send before timing out a connection. The default is 4, therefore a connection will timeout
           after 2 minutes.

EXAMPLES
       Example. afpd.conf default configuration

           - -tcp -noddp -uamlist uams_dhx.so,uams_dhx2.so -nosavepassword

       Example. afpd.conf MacCyrillic setup / UTF8 unix locale

           - -maccodepage mac_cyrillic -unixcodepage utf8

       Example. afpd.conf setup for Kerberos V auth with newline escaping

           - -uamlist uams_dhx.so,uams_dhx2.so,uams_guest.so,uams_gss.so \
           -k5service afpserver -k5keytab /path/to/afpserver.keytab \
           -k5realm YOUR.REALM -fqdn your.fqdn.namel:548

       Example. afpd.conf letting afpd appear as three servers on the net

           "Guest Server" -uamlist uams_guest.so -loginmesg "Welcome guest!"
           "User Server" -uamlist uams_dhx2.so -port 12000
           "special" -ddp -notcp -defaultvol <path> -systemvol <path>
