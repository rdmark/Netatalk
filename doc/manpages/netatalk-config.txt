NETATALK-CONFIG(1)                                        The Netatalk Project                                       NETATALK-CONFIG(1)

NAME
       netatalk-config - script to get information about the installed version of netatalk

SYNOPSIS
       netatalk-config [--prefix [=DIR]] [--exec_prefix [=DIR]] [--help] [--version] [--libs] [--libs-dirs] [--libs-names] [--cflags]
                       [--macros]

DESCRIPTION
       netatalk-config is a tool that is used to determine the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link
       programs that use the netatalk run-time libraries.

OPTIONS
       netatalk-config accepts the following options:

       --help
           Print a short help for this command and exit.

       --version
           Print the currently installed version of netatalk on the standard output.

       --libs
           Print the linker flags that are necessary to link against the netatalk run-time libraries.

       --libs-dirs
           Print only the -l/-R part of --libs.

       --libs-names
           Print only the -l part of --libs.

       --cflags
           Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a program linked against the netatalk run-time libraries.

       --macros
           Print the netatalk m4 directory.

       --prefix=PREFIX
           If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that netatalk was built with when computing the output for the
           --cflags and --libs options. This option is also used for the exec prefix if --exec-prefix was not specified. This option
           must be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --exec\_prefix=PREFIX
           If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec prefix that netatalk was built with when computing the output for
           the --cflags and --libs options. This option must be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.
