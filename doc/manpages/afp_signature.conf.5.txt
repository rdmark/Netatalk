NAME
       afp_signature.conf - Configuration file used by afpd(8) to specify server signature

DESCRIPTION
       /usr/local/etc/netatalk/afp_signature.conf is the configuration file used by afpd to specify server signature automagically. The
       configuration lines are composed like:

       "server name" hexa-string

       The first field is server name. Server names must be quoted if they contain spaces. The second field is the hexadecimal string
       of 32 characters for 16-bytes server signature.

       The leading spaces and tabs are ignored. Blank lines are ignored. The lines prefixed with # are ignored. The illegal lines are
       ignored.

           Note
           Server Signature is unique 16-bytes identifier used to prevent logging on to the same server twice.

           Netatalk 2.0 and earlier generated server signature by using gethostid(). There was a problem that another servers have the
           same signature because the hostid is not unique enough.

           Current netatalk generates the signature from random numbers and saves it into afp_signature.conf. When starting next time,
           it is read from this file.

           This file should not be thoughtlessly edited and be copied onto another server. If it wants to set the signature
           intentionally, use the option "-signature user:xxxx" in afpd.conf. In this case, afp_signature.conf is not used.

EXAMPLES
       Example. afp_signature.conf three servers on one netatalk
