NETATALK.CONF(5)                                              Netatalk 2.2                                             NETATALK.CONF(5)

NAME
       netatalk.conf - Configuration file used by the Netatalk init script to determine its general configuration

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/local/etc/netatalk/netatalk.conf

DESCRIPTION
       /usr/local/etc/netatalk/netatalk.conf is the configuration file used by the Netatalk init script to determine what portions of
       the file system will be shared via AFP, as well as their behaviors.

       If Netatalk has been configured with --enable-systemd, netatalk.conf is NOT used. In this scenario, configure using the systemd
       unit configurations, as well as Netatalk's other configuration files.

       Any line not prefixed with # is interpreted. The configuration lines are composed like:

       option = value

       The possible options and their meanings are:

       AFPD_GUEST
           Sets the id of the guest user to a local user on the system.

       AFPD_MAX_CLIENTS
           Sets the maximum number of clients that can simultaneously connect to the server.

       AFPD_RUN
           Enables the afpd daemon if set to "yes". This should be enabled if you are planning on using netatalk as a file server.

       AFPD_UAM_LIST
           Sets the default UAMs for afpd (and papd, if printer authentication is compiled in) to use.

           Example: AFPD_UAMLIST="-U uams_guest.so,uams_randnum.so"

       CNID_METAD_RUN
           Enables the cnid_metad daemon if set to "yes". This should be enabled if you are going to use the dbd CNID backend.

       CNID_CONFIG
           Configuration options for cnid_metad. See: cnid_metad(8)

       ATALK_BGROUND
           "yes" will set netatalk to initialize in the background, and "no" will cause normal initialization.

       ATALK_NAME
           Sets the machines´ Appletalk name.

       ATALK_ZONE
           Sets the machines´ Appletalk zone.

       ATALKD_RUN
           Enables the atalkd daemon if set to "yes". This should be enabled if you are planning on providing Appletalk services.

       PAPD_RUN
           Enables the papd daemon if set to "yes". This should be enabled if you are planning on using netatalk as a print server.

       ATALK_MAC_CHARSET
           Set the Mac client codepage, used by atalkd and papd to convert extended characters from the Unix to the Mac codepage.

       ATALK_UNIX_CHARSET
           Set the Unix codepage, used by atalkd and papd to convert extended characters from the Unix to the Mac codepage. Has to
           match the codepage of the configuration files.
