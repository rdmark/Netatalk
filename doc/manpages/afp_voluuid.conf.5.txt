AFP_VOLUUID.CONF(5)                                           Netatalk 2.2                                          AFP_VOLUUID.CONF(5)

NAME
       afp_voluuid.conf - Configuration file used by afpd(8) to specify UUID for Time Machine volume

DESCRIPTION
       /usr/local/etc/netatalk/afp_voluuid.conf is the configuration file used by afpd to specify UUID of Time Machine volume
       automagically. The configuration lines are composed like:

       "volume name" uuid-string

       The first field is volume name. Volume names must be quoted if they contain spaces. The second field is the 36 character
       hexadecimal ASCII string representation of a UUID.

       The leading spaces and tabs are ignored. Blank lines are ignored. The lines prefixed with # are ignored. The illegal lines are
       ignored.

           Note
           This UUID is advertised by Zeroconf in order to provide robust disambiguation of Time Machine volume.

           The afpd generates the UUID from random numbers and saves it into afp_voluuid.conf, only when setting "tm" option in
           AppleVolumes file.

           This file should not be thoughtlessly edited and be copied onto another server.

EXAMPLES
       Example. afp_voluuid.conf three TM volumes on one netatalk
