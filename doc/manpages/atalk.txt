NAME
       atalk - AppleTalk protocol family

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <netatalk/at.h>

DESCRIPTION
       The AppleTalk protocol family is a collection of protocols layered above the Datagram Delivery Protocol (DDP), and using
       AppleTalk address format. The AppleTalk family may provide SOCK_STREAM (ADSP), SOCK_DGRAM (DDP), SOCK_RDM (ATP), and
       SOCK_SEQPACKET (ASP). Currently, only DDP is implemented in the kernel; ATP and ASP are implemented in user level libraries; and
       ADSP is planned.

ADDRESSING
       AppleTalk addresses are three byte quantities, stored in network byte order. The include file <netatalk/at.h> defines the
       AppleTalk address format.

       Sockets in the AppleTalk protocol family use the following address structure:

           struct sockaddr_at {
               short sat_family;
               u_char sat_port;
               struct at_addr sat_addr;
               char sat_zero[ 8 ];
           };

       The port of a socket may be set with bind(2). The node for bind must always be ATADDR_ANYNODE: ``this node.´´ The net may be
       ATADDR_ANYNET or ATADDR_LATENET.  ATADDR_ANYNET coresponds to the machine´s ``primary´´ address (the first configured).
       ATADDR_LATENET causes the address in outgoing packets to be determined when a packet is sent, i.e. determined late.
       ATADDR_LATENET is equivalent to opening one socket for each network interface. The port of a socket and either the primary
       address or ATADDR_LATENET are returned with getsockname(2).

SEE ALSO
       bind(2), getsockname(2), atalkd(8).
