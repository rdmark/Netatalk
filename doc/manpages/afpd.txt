SYNOPSIS
       afpd [-duptDTI] [-f defaultvolumes] [-s systemvolumes] [-n nbpname] [-c maxconnections] [-g guest] [-P pidfile] [-S port]

                afpd -v | -V | -h

DESCRIPTION
       afpd provides an Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) interface to the Unix file system. It is normally started at boot time from
       /etc/rc.

       /usr/local/etc/netatalk/afpd.conf is the configuration file used by afpd to determine the behavior and configuration of the
       different virtual file servers that it provides.

       The list of volumes offered to the user is generated from /usr/local/etc/netatalk/AppleVolumes.system and one of
       /usr/local/etc/netatalk/AppleVolumes.default, ~/AppleVolumes, ~/.AppleVolumes, ~/applevolumes, or ~/.applevolumes. The
       AppleVolumes files is used to specify volumes to mount and file name extension mappings.

OPTIONS
       -d
           Specifies that the daemon should not fork. If netatalk has been configured with --enable-debug1, a trace of all AFP commands
           will be written to stdout.

       -p
           Prevents clients from saving their passwords. (Equivalent to -nosavepasswd in afpd.conf.)

       -t
           Allows clients to change their passwords. (Equivalent to -setpasswd in afpd.conf.)

       -D
           Use DDP (AppleTalk) as transport protocol. (Equivalent to -ddp in afpd.cond.)

       -T
           Use TCP/IP as transport protocol. (Equivalent to -tcp in afpd.conf.)

       -v
           Print version information and exit.

       -V
           Print verbose information and exit.

       -h
           Print help and exit.

       -I
           Use a platform specific icon. (Equivalent to -icon in afpd.conf.) (Recent Mac OS don´t display it.)

       -f defaultvolumes
           Specifies that defaultvolumes should be read for a list of default volumes to offer, instead of
           /usr/local/etc/netatalk/AppleVolumes.default.

       -s systemvolumes
           Specifies that systemvolumes should be read for a list of volume that all users will be offered, instead of
           /usr/local/etc/netatalk/AppleVolumes.system.

       -u
           Read the user´s AppleVolumes file first. This option causes volume names in the user´s AppleVolumes file to override volume
           names in the system´s AppleVolumes file. The default is to read the system AppleVolumes file first. Note that this option
           doesn´t effect the precendence of filename extension mappings: the user´s AppleVolumes file always has precedence.

       -n nbpname
           Specifies that nbpname should be used for NBP registration, instead of the first component of the hostname in the local
           zone.

       -c maxconnections
           Specifies the maximum number of connections to allow for this afpd. The default is 20.

       -g guest
           Specifies the name of the guest account. The default is ´nobody´.

       -P pidfile
           Specifies the file in which afpd stores its process id.

       -S port
           Specifies the port to register with when doing AFPoverTCP. Defaults to 548. (Equivalent to -port in afpd.conf.)

       -L message
           Specifies the login message that will be sent to clients. (Equivalent to -loginmsg in afpd.conf.)

       -F configfile
           Specifies the configuration file to use. (Defaults to /usr/local/etc/netatalk/netatalk/afpd.conf.)

       -U uams
           Comma-separated list of UAMs to use for the authentication process. (Equivalent to -uamlist in afpd.conf.)

       -m umask
           Use this umask for the creation of folders in Netatalk.

SIGNALS
       To shut down a user´s afpd process it is recommended that SIGKILL (-9) NOT be used, except as a last resort, as this may leave
       the CNID database in an inconsistent state. The safe way to terminate an afpd is to send it a SIGTERM (-15) signal and wait for
       it to die on its own.

       SIGTERM and SIGUSR1 signals that are sent to the main afpd process are propagated to the children, so all will be affected.

       SIGTERM
           Clean exit. Propagates from master to childs.

       SIGQUIT
           Send this to the master afpd, it will exit leaving all children running! Can be used to implement AFP service without
           downtime.

       SIGHUP
           Sending a SIGHUP to afpd will cause it to reload its configuration files.

       SIGINT
           Sending a SIGINT to a child afpd enables max_debug logging for this process. The log is sent to fhe file
           /tmp/afpd.PID.XXXXXX. Sending another SIGINT will revert to the original log settings.

       SIGUSR1
           The afpd process will send the message "The server is going down for maintenance." to the client and shut itself down in 5
           minutes. New connections are not allowed. If this is sent to a child afpd, the other children are not affected. However, the
           main process will still exit, disabling all new connections.

       SIGUSR2
           The afpd process will look in the message directory configured at build time for a file named message.pid. For each one
           found, a the contents will be sent as a message to the associated AFP client. The file is removed after the message is sent.
           This should only be sent to a child afpd.
