NAME
       atalk_aton - AppleTalk address parsing

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <netatalk/at.h>

       atalk_aton(char * cp, struct at_addr * ata);

DESCRIPTION
       The atalk_aton() routine converts an ASCII representation of an AppleTalk address to a format appropriate for system calls.
       Acceptable ASCII representations include both hex and base 10, in triples or doubles. For instance, the address `0x1f6b.77´ has
       a network part of `8043´ and a node part of `119´. This same address could be written `8043.119´, `31.107.119´, or `0x1f.6b.77´.
       If the address is in hex and the first digit is one of `A-F´, a leading `0x´ is redundant.
