NAME
       cnid_metad - start cnid_dbd daemons on request

SYNOPSIS
       cnid_metad [-l loglevel [-f filename]] [-d] [-h hostname] [-p port] [-u user] [-g group] [-s cnid_dbdpathname]
                            cnid_metad -v | -V

DESCRIPTION
       cnid_metad waits for requests from afpd to start up instances of the cnid_dbd daemon. It keeps track of the status of a cnid_dbd
       instance once started and will restart it if necessary.  cnid_metad is normally started at boot time from /etc/rc or equivalent
       and runs until shutdown.  afpd needs to be configured with the -cnidserver option in afpd.conf in order to access cnid_metad.
       It is possible to run more than one instance of cnid_metad on the same machine if different values for the interface and/or port
       are specified with the -h and -p options.

OPTIONS
       -l <loglevel> [-f <filename>]
           Specify that any message of a loglevel up to the given loglevel should be logged to the given file. If the filename is
           ommited the loglevel applies to messages passed to syslog. Default is logs to syslog with a default logging setup of
           "log_note".

           Note: cnid_metad passes this to cnid_dbd which will in turn use this for its logging setup.

           loglevels: LOG_SEVERE, LOG_ERROR, LOG_WARN, LOG_NOTE, LOG_INFO, LOG_DEBUG, LOG_DEBUG6, LOG_DEBUG7, LOG_DEBUG8, LOG_DEBUG9,
           LOG_MAXDEBUG

           Example. Useful default config

               -l log_info -f /var/log/afpd.log

           Example. Debugging config

               -l log_maxdebug -f /var/log/afpd.log

       -d
           cnid_metad will remain in the foreground and will also leave the standard input, standard output and standard error file
           descriptors open. Useful for debugging.

       -h hostname
           Use hostname as the network interface for requests as opposed to the default localhost. The network address may be specified
           either in dotted-decimal format for IPv4 or in hexadecimal format for IPv6.

       -p port
           Use port as the port number for reqests. Default is 4700.

       -u user
           Switch to the userid of user before serving requests. This userid will be inherited by all cnid_dbd daemon processes
           started.

       -g group
           Switch to the groupid of group before serving requests. This groupid will be inherited by all cnid_dbd daemon processes
           started. Both user and group must be specified as strings.

       -s cnid_dbd pathname
           Use cnid_dbd pathname as the pathname of the executeable of the cnid_dbd daemon. The default is /usr/local/sbin/cnid_dbd.

       -v, -V
           Show version and exit.

CAVEATS
       The number of cnid_dbd subprocecesses is currently limited to 512.

       cnid_metad does not block or catch any signals apart from SIGPIPE. It will therefore exit on most signals received. This will
       also cause all instances of cnid_dbdÂ´s started by that cnid_metad to exit gracefully. Since state about and IPC access to the
       subprocesses is only maintained in memory by cnid_metad this is desired behaviour. As soon as cnid_metad is restarted afpd
       processes will transparently reconnect.
