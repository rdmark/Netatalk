DBD(1)                                                        Netatalk 2.2                                                       DBD(1)

NAME
       dbd - CNID database maintenance

SYNOPSIS
       dbd [-evx] {-d [-i]  | -s [-c|-n]  | -r [-c|-f]  | -u} volumepath

DESCRIPTION
       dbd can dump, scan, reindex and rebuild Netatalk dbd CNID databases. It must be run with appropiate permissions i.e. as root.
       dbd -s|-r can be run on active volumes, but dbd -rf, which wipes the db before rebuilding it, checks and enforces that the
       chosen volume is not in use.

COMMANDS
       -d
           Dump CNID database. With -i dump indexes too.

       -s
           Scan volume:

           •   Compare CNIDs in database with volume

           •   Test if .AppleDouble directories exist

           •   Test if AppleDouble files exist

           •   Report orphaned AppleDouble files

           •   Report directories inside .AppleDouble directories

           •   Check name encoding by roundtripping, log on error

           •   Check for orphaned CNIDs in database (requires -e)

           •   Open and close adouble files

               Options:
                   -c Don´t check .AppleDouble stuff, only check orphaned.  -n Don´t open CNID database, skip CNID checks, only
                   traverse filesystem

           -r
               Rebuild volume. With -f wipe database and rebuild from CNIIDs stored in AppleDouble files.

               •   Sync CNIDSs from database with volume

               •   Ensure .AppleDouble directories exist

               •   Ensure AppleDouble files exist

               •   Delete orphaned AppleDouble files

               •   Report directories inside .AppleDouble directories

               •   Check name encoding by roundtripping, log on error

               •   Delete orphaned CNIDs in database (requires -e)

               •   Open and close adouble files

                   Options:
                       -c Don´t create .AppleDouble stuff, only cleanup orphaned.

                       -f Wipe database and rebuild from IDs stored in AppleDouble files, only available for volumes without
                       nocnidcache option. Implies -e.

               -u
                   Upgrade:

                   Opens the database which triggers any necessary upgrades, then closes and exits.

OPTIONS
       -e
           Only work on inactive volumes and lock them (exclusive)

       -x
           Rebuild indexes (just for completeness, mostly useless!)

       -v
           verbose

WARNING
       In order to be able to run -rf reconstructing the CNIDs in the database from the AppleDouble files, make sure you´ve run a -r
       rebuild sometimes before, where the CNIDs then would have been synched between database and AppleDouble files.

       Also be careful about the option nocnidcache. Avoid this option if at all possible, because if prevents you from being able to
       use -f.

CNID BACKGROUND
       The CNID backends maintains name to ID mappings. If you change a filename outside afpd(8) (shell, samba), the CNID db will not
       know and not reflect that change. Netatalk tries to recover from such inconsistencies as gracefully as possible. The mechanisms
       to resolve such inconsistencies may fail sometimes, though, as this is not an easy task to accomplish. E.g. if several names in
       the path to the file or directory have changed, things may go wrong.

       If you change a lot of filenames at once, chances are higher that the afpds fallback mechanisms fail, i.e. files will be
       assigned new IDs, even though the file hasn´t changed.
