NAME
       nbp_name - NBP name parsing

SYNOPSIS
       int nbp_name(char *name, char **obj, char **type, char **zone);

DESCRIPTION
       nbp_name() parses user supplied names into their component object, type, and zone.  obj, type, and zone should be passed by
       reference, and should point to the caller´s default values.  nbp_name() will change the pointers to the parsed-out values.  name
       is of the form object:type@zone, where each of object, :type, and @zone replace obj, type, and zone, respectively.  type must be
       proceeded by `:´, and zone must be preceded by `@´.

EXAMPLE
       The argument of afpd(8)´s -n option is parsed with nbp_name(). The default value of obj is the first component of the machine´s
       hostname (as returned by gethostbyname(3)). The default value of type is ``AFPServer´´, and of zone is ``*´´, the default zone.
       To cause afpd to register itself in some zone other than the default, one would invoke it as

           afpd -n @some-other-zone

       obj and type would retain their default values.

BUGS
       obj, type, and zone return pointers into static area which may be over-written on each call.
