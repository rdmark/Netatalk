NAME
       getzones - list AppleTalk zone names

SYNOPSIS
       getzones [-m | -l] [address]

DESCRIPTION
       Getzones is used to obtain a list of AppleTalk zone names using the Zone Information Protocol (ZIP). It sends a GetZoneList
       request to an AppleTalk router. By default, it sends the request to the locally running atalkd(8).

OPTIONS
       -m
           List the name of the local zone only; this is accomplished by sending a ZIP GetMyZone request.

       -l
           List the local zones; this is accomplished by sending a GetLocalZones request.

       address
           Contact the AppleTalk router at address.  address is parsed by atalk_aton(3).
