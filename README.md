# Netatalk 2.x
A fork of the Netatalk 2 codebase which takes in post-2.2.6 downstream patches from various sources, while adding some modern conveniences such as [systemd unit configurations for all daemons](https://github.com/rdmark/Netatalk/tree/branch-netatalk-2-2-x/distrib/initscripts).

The primary focus of this fork is to have a version of Netatalk 2 that runs well on modern OSes, in particular Linux and NetBSD.

As of Netatalk 3.0, support for Apple's legacy AppleTalk (DDP) protocol was dropped. AppleTalk is required for Macs running System 6.0 through Mac OS 7.6, as well as supported Apple II systems, to be able to connect to an AppleShare server out of the box. Additionally, AppleTalk support brings the convenience of a printer server (papd) which can act as a two-way bridge for using modern printers on old Macs, and vice versa, as well as a time server (timelord,) plus an Apple II netboot server (a2boot.)

At the same time, the ability of Netatalk 2.2 to understand both AppleTalk (DDP) and TCP/IP (DSI) allows it to serve as a bridge between very old Apple II and Mac systems, and modern macOS and other systems that understand AFP.

Hence, the need among the vintage Apple community to keep maintaining the Netatalk 2.2 codebase.

# Installation
Follow the installation steps in the [official Netatalk 2.2 documentation](http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/2.2/htmldocs/installation.html) to configure and install Netatalk.

As supplementary information when installing on Debian derivate Linux distros, you need at least these apt packages:
```
libcups2-dev libssl-dev libdb-dev autotools-dev automake libtool
```

A breakdown of optional packages:
- ``` libavahi-client-dev ``` -- Needed for zeroconf service discovery on Mac OS X / macOS
- ``` libgcrypt20-dev ``` -- Needed for the DHX2 UAM that allows you to authenticate with a Mac OS X / macOS client

An example configuration that enables systemd services, as well as Zeroconf for Bonjour service discovery on Mac OS X:
```
$ ./configure --enable-systemd --enable-zeroconf
```
