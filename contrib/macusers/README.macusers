This was originally a perl script that did a lot of unnecessary calculation to
essentially grep the output of ps.  Rewritten to be actually useful in
netatalk-classic.

Original:

"This script is very similar to the nu script, but it shows more detailed
information.  However, since ps and lsof outputs vary, it may need some
modifications to work in Unixes other than Red Hat linux."
